# Cloud Tenant Create Returns 500

## Symptom

Super Admin → **Cloud** → **Create Cloud Tenant** fails with `Internal server error` (HTTP 500). Health check may still be green.

## Likely causes (fresh / wiped DB)

1. **Missing `plans` rows** — `tenants.plan_id` FK to `plans(id)`. Create defaults to `BASIC`. If plans were never seeded or were deleted, Postgres raises `23503` → was surfaced as 500.
2. **RLS on `users` (and sibling tables)** — log shows `42501` / `new row violates row-level security policy for table "users"` at `provisionTenant`. Happens when policies are enforced (leftover `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, or a non-owner DB role) and `app.tenant_id` was unset in the SA create transaction.
3. **Empty slug** — company names with only non-Latin characters used to produce `slug = ''`.
4. **Invalid custom `planId`** — UI/API sent a plan id that does not exist.

Self-serve `/api/auth/signup` is disabled (`410`); cloud companies are created only via `POST /api/super-admin/tenants`.

## Fix in code (current)

- `ensureDefaultPlans()` runs on boot and again immediately before SA tenant create.
- `provisionTenant` / `deleteTenant` call `setTenantContext` inside the transaction so RLS `WITH CHECK` / `USING` match the new tenant id (SA path only).
- Boot `initSchema` runs `NO FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on tenant tables to clear leftover FORCE from the reverted experiment (owner bypass restored as designed; normal tenant handlers still use `WHERE tenant_id`).
- `provisionTenant` rejects unknown plans with `INVALID_PLAN` (400) and never inserts an empty slug.
- FK `23503` on create maps to 400 with a clear message.

## Manual recovery on Render (if old deploy)

1. Open Render → your live web service (`dhandho`, or legacy `dg-erp` until hostname cutover) → Logs; search `Tenant create failed` / `42501` / `row-level security` / `23503` / `tenants_plan_id_fkey`.
2. Redeploy a build that includes SA `setTenantContext` + plans ensure (or restart so boot seed / `NO FORCE` cleanup runs).
3. Confirm plans: Super Admin → Plans should list Trial / Basic / Standard / Professional.
4. Retry Create Cloud Tenant with a unique admin email.

## Retry checklist

1. Log in at `https://dhandho.onrender.com/super-admin` (or your `PUBLIC_APP_URL`).
2. Cloud tab → Create Cloud Tenant.
3. Fill company, admin name/email, pick a plan, business type → submit.
4. Share the returned login URL `/{slug}` plus temp password with the customer.
