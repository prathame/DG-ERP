# Service Cloud Seats — Manual / E2E Cases

Online-only seats on a **service** cloud tenant. Clients: Cloud Electron + online Capacitor. **One live session company-wide.** Idle auto-release **5 minutes**. No takeover. Separate from offline Service Mobile (`DG-SM-`).

| # | Case | Steps | Expected |
|---|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Access mode unset | Service tenant → seats panel; leave mode unset; try claim from Electron | Claim rejected until SA sets mobile / desktop / both |
| 2 | Set access mode | SA sets **both** | Mode saved; panel reflects selection |
| 3 | Create user + slots | SA Add user with name/email/password, 1 mobile + 1 desktop | User created; unbound slots listed |
| 4 | Bind desktop | Login Cloud Electron as that user | Device claims desktop slot; session acquire succeeds |
| 5 | Second device busy | Second user/device opens app while first holds session | Freeze overlay “In use by …” — UI unresponsive. Phone Emergent IA (`isServicePhoneUx`) does **not** bypass or change this gate |
| 6 | No takeover | Busy client waits; does not steal | Stays frozen until holder leaves or idle 5m |
| 7 | Holder release | Holder closes app / logout | Second client can acquire within ~15s retry |
| 8 | Idle release | Holder leaves app open but idle >5m (or stop heartbeats) | Session expires; other client can acquire |
| 9 | Offline freeze | Holder online → airplane mode | Overlay “No internet”; UI frozen |
| 10 | Mobile-only mode | SA sets mobile only → open Electron | Claim/acquire blocked |
| 11 | Unbind lost device | SA Unbind on bound slot → new device login | New machine claims free slot |
| 12 | Cannot shrink below bound | Bound 1 desktop; set desktop slots to 0 without unbind | API error; must unbind first |
| 13 | Browser not enrolled | Login in normal browser (no Electron/Capacitor) | No seat gate; claim with web client rejected |
| 14 | Manufacturer tenant | Open manufacturer tenant detail | Cloud app seats panel shown; multi-user (no company freeze); Cap Online features when mode is mobile/both |
| 15 | Not Service Mobile | Compare with Service Mobile licenses | No `DG-SM-` key; uses cloud tenant users |
| 16 | Download page split | Open `/download` | **Service Cloud ONLINE** and **Service Mobile OFFLINE** are separate cards; Android + iOS buttons each (4 evergreen links) |
| 17 | Set download URL | SA → Analytics → paste Service Cloud URLs → Save → open `/download` | Buttons use those URLs |
| 18 | Default Offline Mobile | Clear `service_mobile_app_url` / `service_mobile_ios_url` → `/download` | Offline uses GitHub evergreen APK + `.app.zip` without SA paste |
| 23 | Default Online Cap | Clear `service_cloud_app_url` / `service_cloud_ios_url` → `/download` | Online uses `service-cloud` APK + `.app.zip` |
| 24 | CI builds Online Cap only | Label PR `online` (or `service-cloud`), merge — or comment `apk build online` | Online APK + iOS jobs run; Offline skipped. Evergreen `service-cloud` updates on merge |
| 25 | Online APK app id | After `npm run cap:sync:cloud`, open `android/app/build.gradle` | `applicationId "in.dhandho.servicecloud"` (not Offline `in.dhandho.service`) so both can install |
| 19 | Share reset link | Seats user card → Share reset link → Copy | Modal shows link; user can reset on Cap or Electron |
| 20 | Notify one user | Seats → Notify on user A; login as A and B | Only A sees the in-app message |
| 21 | Live badge (Cap) | Online Cap + service tenant logged in | Sidebar shows Live · Online; no Sync control. Desktop Electron chrome unchanged |
| 22 | Airplane Cap | Cap holder → airplane mode | Freeze “No internet”; app unresponsive |
| 26 | Cap first open → company slug | Fresh Online Cap install (no session) | **Not** marketing LandingPage. Enter company URL slug → Continue preflights cloud `by-slug` (API origin = `VITE_API_ORIGIN` or Render fallback on Cap localhost) → branded login at `/{slug}`. Failures (invalid / reserved / not-found / network) call `reportSlugOnboardingFailure` → write-through localStorage client logs + Cap `Dhandho/bug-reports` file; **Share bug report** includes `Last error` and non-empty **Recent client logs**. Returning users with `dg_last_slug` skip to that company. Change company returns to slug entry. Reserved: `admin`/`privacy`/`terms`/`download` show clear error; `test` is allowed |
